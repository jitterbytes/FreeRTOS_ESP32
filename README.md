# FreeRTOS_ESP32
Finally decided to get into FreeRTOS after delaying it for so long XD
So this Repo is all the things i tried with FreeRTOS i did made a Roadmap so that i can atleast touch all the concepts regarding FreeRTOS  
**Do some experiments write some code see them in action is what my main motive i want to seee o_O  **
Even though its kinda my journal i am trying to be professional and like organized so that all the READMEs look same like similar headings obv diff content  

These are the topics i shortlisted and they will sub topics inside them.
