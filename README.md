# FreeRTOS_ESP32
This repo is basically me understanding the fundamentals of FreeRTOS and experimenting them on a ESP32 Dev board.  
It will feel like a workbook its me teaching myself I got Roadmap for myself using AI hopefully it will cover all the fundamentals included in FreeRTOS.  

I have placed multiple READMEs in sub directories so that i can write in those and i have tried to be descriptive as much as possible 

These are the topics in the Roadmap were these and they all have sub directories 
```
FreeRTOS_ESP32/
  1_Tasks/
  2_Communication/
  3_Timing/
  4_Advanced/
  5_Benchmarking/
  6_Projects/
```
All the sub directories will have their indiviual READMEs in them easier for me to handle them.
